# My neovim configuration 

This neovim configuration started as a copy of [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).
It is now fairly different, but I could not have gotten to where it is now without the kickstart.

This is setup to run under powershell and windows.
The primary language support is python. Plans are to extend into cmake/c++/c.

There is nothing clever here.
